#This week we will create a program that performs file processing activities.
#Your program this week will use the OS library in order to validate that a directory exists before creating a file in that directory. 
#Your program will prompt the user for the directory they would like to save the file in as well as the name of the file. 
#The program should then prompt the user for their name, address, and phone number. 
#Your program will write this data to a comma separated line in a file and store the file in the directory specified by the user. 

#Once the data has been written your program should read the file you just wrote to the file system and display the file contents to 
#the user for validation purposes. 

#Submit a link to your Github repository.

#Import the OS Library.
import os

    #Keep running until correct directory was specified and file was written to and read.
    while True:

        #Get user input for required fields.
        directory = input("Enter the directory that you want to save the file : ")
        filename = input("Enter the filename : ")
        name = input("Enter your name : ")
        address = input("Enter your address : ")
        phone_number = input("Enter your phone number : ")


        #Directory validation.
        if os.path.isdir(directory):

            #Create, open, write to and close file.
            writeFile = open(os.path.join(directory,filename),'w')
            writeFile.write(name+','+address+','+phone_number+'\n')
            writeFile.close()
            print("File contents:")
